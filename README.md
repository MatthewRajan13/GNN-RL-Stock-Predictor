# GNN-Stock-Predictor
This is a project focused on creating a graph consiting of stocks in the S&P 500 in order to summarize correlations and relataionships between companies. A Graph Neural Network (GAT or GraphSAGE) will be used in order to conduct link prediction to determine how correlated a chosen stock is to others in the S&P 500. This information is then passed and utilized in a Reinforcement Learning agent that will train on historic data and predict trades.
